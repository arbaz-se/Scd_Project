<p><b>ARBITRATION</b></p>

<p>All disputes the Company or you has relating in any way to any program or your relationship with the Company (including, without limitation, your transactions with the Company, the Company’s advertisements and disclosures, email and mobile SMS (text) messages the Company sends to you, or the use or disclosure of any information about you), privacy policies, or terms of use will be submitted to confidential arbitration in the federal judicial district in which you reside, except to the extent that you have, in any way, violated or threatened to violate any Company intellectual property right. Disputes include claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or the Company’s negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or claims from any other source of law.</p>

<p>To invoke arbitration, you must first send to the Company, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to the Company must be mailed to 4901 Vineland Road, Suite 300, Orlando, FL 32811 Attn: Legal Department.

<p>All arbitrations required by these Terms of Use will be conducted before a single arbitrator under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures of JAMS. If there is a conflict between the JAMS rules and these Terms of Use, the Terms of Use will govern. The arbitration will be held in location chosen by the Company unless you and the Company agree to another location or to conduct the arbitration by telephone. The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration brought under, or with respect to, any claim is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms of Use, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless the Company and you agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general, or class proceeding.</p>
